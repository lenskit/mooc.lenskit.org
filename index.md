This page documents using LensKit in a classroom environment.

- [Setting up the environment](setup.html)
- [Javadoc for LensKit 3.0-T1](apidocs/)

Michael finds the [Javadoc Search Frame](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/3758-javadoc-search-frame) user script to be super-useful for working with Javadoc.
